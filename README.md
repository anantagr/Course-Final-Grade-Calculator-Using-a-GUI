Description:        The intent of this application is to provide a tool to instructors that they can use to calculate
                    the final mark of a course as both a percentage and letter grade. When run, the application will
                    display a window form with data entry fields for quiz marks, a midterm mark, and a final examination
                    mark. The final grade is calculated using the weightings of 20% for the average of the quizzes, 30% 
                    for the midterm mark, and 50% for the final grade. The final grade percentage mark is converted to a 
                    letter grade using the same table included in the later section.
